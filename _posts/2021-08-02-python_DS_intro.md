## 1. Introduction to the Data Professions

- Data science: systematic study of structure and behavior of data

  - past + current ==> predict future
  - interestd in **why over how**
  - uncover **correlations and causations** in data to support decision-making

- Data engineering: design, construction, and maintenance of data systems

  - prefer to design and build IT systems (rather than to analyze data)
  - interested in **how over why**
  - design systems to collect, handle, and store big datasets
  - build modular, scalable platforms for data processing

- Data analytics: data products that describe data and how it behaves by **data analysis and visualization processes**
  - use applications to analyze data (**without coding**)
  - deploys analytics technologies (analytics S/W applications)

## 2. Data Science

- Data Analysis: process for making sense of data
  - includes data cleaning, reformatting, and recombining data
  - discovers real-life phenomenon data
- Data Science:
- Artificial Intelligence: a machine or application with the capacity to **autonomously execute upon predictions** it makes from data
  1. Prediction: predictive modeling (from data science)
  2. Execution: autonomous response (from engineering)
- Deep learning: set of predictive methodologies that borrows its structure from the _Neural Network_ structures of the brain
  - effective for **making predictions** from big data
  - can be used as a **decision model** with applications to produce deep learning AI
