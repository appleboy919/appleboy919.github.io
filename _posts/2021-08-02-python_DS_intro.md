## 1. Introduction to the Data Professions

- Functions within the Data Space:

  - Data science: systematic study of structure and behavior of data

    - past + current ==> predict future
    - interestd in **why over how**
    - uncover **correlations and causations** in data to support decision-making

  - Data engineering: design, construction, and maintenance of data systems

    - prefer to design and build IT systems (rather than to analyze data)
    - interested in **how over why**
    - design systems to collect, handle, and store big datasets
    - build modular, scalable platforms for data processing

  - Data analytics: data products that describe data and how it behaves by **data analysis and visualization processes**

    - use applications to analyze data (**without coding**)
    - deploys analytics technologies (analytics S/W applications)
